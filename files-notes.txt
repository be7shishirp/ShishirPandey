Notes:
- These files are a starting, complete and working baseline. Copy each code block into separate files with the filenames shown.
- The live-age uses Gregorian math with the provided AD birth date/time. If you want strict Nepali (BS) live counting, I can integrate a BS calendar converter or an API â€” but that needs either a library or a server/API.
- Daily rasifal and astrology require an external data source or manual content.
- Replace placeholder images with your real photos.
